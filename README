lfhex -> large file hex editor

Motivation:
Provide a fast/easy to use hex editor for viewing/modifying files which are
too large to hold in system memory.

Highlights:
- supports large offsets (files > 2Gig)
- small memory footprint. Opening a 2gig file should only use an additional
  1.4megs.
- fast load times.
- fast save times.
- infinite undo/redo (as memory permits).
- conversion dialog (linked to selection).
	o can byteswap data before conversion.
- search capability.
- scalable working area (resize is sane and can use as much screen as you give
  it).
- runtime configurable editing mode (hex/octal/binary/ascii).
- runtime configurable bytes per column.
- binary comparison user interface 
	o differences can be walked through byte by byte.
	o offsets need not match between buffers. e.g: you can start the
	  comparison from one cursor position in the first file and use
	  a different cursor position in the second file.
	o differences can be walked through block by block.
	o blocks can be 1-16 bytes long and can be aligned with a
	  0-15 byte offset.

Limitations:
- no insertion/truncate.
- cannot search if file is modified.
- "Save As" is as slow as file copy.
- search times slow (on my Celeron 566 with 7.2k ide drive they take about
  1sec/Meg and is almost 3x slower if progressbar pops up).
- comparison mode is not allowed if either buffer has unsaved modifications.

Usage notes:
- to invoke comparison mode, put "-c" on the command line:
% lfhex -c file1 file2
- you can enter multiple files on the command line.

Please let me know if you find this software useful (or if it is crap :)
